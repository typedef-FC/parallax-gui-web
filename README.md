# parallax-gui-web

Conversion of the `parallax_gui.lua` GUI to web content. This repository is used by `parallax_gui.lua` to retrieve the latest web content per launch.

Style is bland and contains nothing outside the mandatory necessities. Feel free to submit style changes on the [External Menu for Constellation4 thread](https://constelia.ai/forums/index.php?threads/external-menu-for-constellation4.7809/). You can turn off `parallax_gui.lua.auto_update` to prevent the script from overwriting your style.

The source code for `parallax_gui.lua` is found [on the source page](https://constelia.ai/members/source.php?id=241).
